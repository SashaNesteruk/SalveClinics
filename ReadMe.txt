Instructions: 

BackEnd - use any IDE of your choice to statrt the SalveClinics projects in your IISExpress

FrontEnd - Launch Angular Project in app folder in your Visual Studio Code. 
           Then make sure you have got Angular installed  of version 13. Run NPM INSTALL command to restore libraries.
	   RUn the project using NG SERVE command.
           Make sure your host for the app is localhost:4200;

Annotations:

The solution contains a back end project which is of a full production quality with unit and integration tests.
The front end app is a basic div with a drop down and a table that is implemented with Angular Material. You can sort table on the first column.
You can also use pagination.

Things I could have done:

The front end app for time constrained reasons could have been completed with better design and austhetics. 
Karma tests could have been added to unit test behaviour of the dropdown and the table.

I could also provide built Angular project, 
but this would require any sort of Lite server installed on the machine, which would further complicate the assessment of this test.

For the Back End I would explicitly test the repositories as part of my integration test
